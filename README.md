# APEX-SERT
Security Evaluation and Recommendation Tool for Oracle Application Express

APEX-SERT is an APEX application that evaluates your APEX applications for security vulnerabilities.  It installs into an instnace of APEX and is immediately available for all developers using their existing credentials.

Currently, APEX-SERT support APEX 4.2.  Support for APEX 5 will be coming in early 2016.  

### Documentation
At this point, all APEX-SERT documentation is included with the build as PDF files.  Starting with APEX-SERT 5, documentation will move to Markdown format.
